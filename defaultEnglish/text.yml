# How to edit: simply change the text inside the quotes following the text: parameter!

# Variables: The curly braces {mobName}, {resourceName}, etc are variables for the phrase, to print dynamic data on
# screen. For example "You have {amount} villagers", {amount} would be the villager count itself. These must remain
# in the translated version as well, or the actual data will never be displayed.

# Currently ONLY SUPPORTED IN DEATH MESSAGES there is a gender variable, for example a line you need to translate may
# say "No one liked (him:her:them) anyway.", the variable inside is always formatting (male:female:none), and the correct 
# gender will be picked based on (obviously) the gender of the mob that died. You can change the contents of the variables 
# in any way you desire, as long as all three are there. You may also add or remove them as needed. Some languages 
# (particularly the romance languages) may require you to change the entire structure of the sentence based on the 
# gender reporting the message. For now, there's a small work around for this. Because you can put anything you want in 
# the variables, you can do something like this; "(No one liked him anyway.:No one liked her anyway.:No one liked them anyway.)"
# and rather than just replacing him, her or them, it'll replace the entire line. This will allow you to restructure the 
# entire sentence depending on what gender has died.

# Colors: If you need to change around the coloring of text, it's fairly simple. Most text by default is white, you need
# to add $COL1 where "COL" is the color code, and 0 through 2 is the brightness. Most text should have brightness set
# to 1. I recommend not changing the color codes used in each line (Although you can, it won't hurt anything), but for
# your language you may have to rearrange them a bit. Remember, changing the color will change all the color following
# that line until another color code is entered. So "My cat is $RED1red, and it's pretty!" will make "red, and it's
# pretty!" all in red. Where as "My cat is $RED1red$WHI0, and it's pretty!" will only set the word "red" to the color RED1.

# Valid Color Codes:
# White/Default:  WHI0
# Yellow:         YEL0, YEL1, YEL2
# Red:            RED0, RED1, RED2
# Green:          GRE0, GRE1, GRE2
# Blue:           BLU0, BLU1, BLU2
# Black/Grey:     BLA0, BLA1, BLA2
# Cyan:           CYA0, CYA1, CYA2
# Pink:           PIN0, PIN1, PIN2
# Orange:         ORA0, ORA1, ORA2
# Magenta:        MAG0, MAG1, MAG2

# Line Breaks: DO NOT EVER HIT ENTER/RETURN TO MAKE LINE BREAKS. To make a line break you must use the tilde (~) key.
# For example; "This is Line 1,~and this is Line 2" will print two lines, with "This is Line 1" on line one, and "and
# this is Line 2." on the second.

# Any time a line is left blank or removed, the game will load the default English version. Although I recommend not
# touching any lines you do not wish to translate.

# If an entry has optional: "true" directly below any text:, you are not required to translate that line. But you
# may if you choose to, it just won't count to reaching 100%.

# You can add forceCount: "true" directly below any text: line to tell the game that line is in fact translated,
# in the rare case no translation is actually required. For example, the word "Bandage" is the same in English and
# French, and thus there's no reason to translate it.
